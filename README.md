GitHub Profile Setup Guide
I prepared the files for your new dynamic profile, but I could not create the repository automatically due to permission restrictions with your token.

Instructions
1. Create the Repository
Go to GitHub - Create a new repository.
Repository name: arun-kumar-2015 (It must match your username exactly).
Public: Ensure it is set to Public.
Check "Add a README file".
Click Create repository.
2. Update README.md
Go to your new repository: https://github.com/arun-kumar-2015/arun-kumar-2015.
Click the Pencil icon to edit 

README.md
.
Copy the content from the file linked below (

PROFILE_README.md
) and paste it into the editor, replacing everything.
Click Commit changes.
3. Add Snake Animation (Optional)
In your repository, click Add file -> Create new file.
Name the file: .github/workflows/snake.yml.
Copy the content from the file linked below (

snake.yml
) and paste it in.
Click Commit changes.
Go to the Actions tab in your repository and verify the workflow runs (it might take a few minutes or require a manual trigger).
